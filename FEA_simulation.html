            <b>Abstract:</b> Honda Aircraft Company’s HA-420 HondaJet is a lightweight, twin-engine, six-seat business
            jet, having its first flight in 2014. The CEO of Honda Aircraft Company, Michimasa Fujino, decided that he
            wanted his company to come out with a breakthrough in not only the small and elite business jet market, but
            in the field of aeronautical engineering as a whole. Along with implementing several effective practices,
            like Natural Laminar Flow, composite fuselage and an extensive marketing strategy, one of the company’s most
            revolutionary breakthroughs is the Over-The-Wing-Engine-Design. Just like it sounds, unlike other jets or
            aircraft, this one has its engine mounted on top of the wing. It was proven through research papers that
            this design reduced drag, produced more life, and eventually proved to me more effective. The research
            papers that support these claims are all available on the website of Honda Aircraft Company.
