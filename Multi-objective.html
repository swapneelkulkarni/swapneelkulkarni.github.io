            <b>Abstract:</b>
            As part of the Characterization of Advanced Composites class, conducted by Dr. R. Byron Pipes, we class
            conducted an
            experiment to perform a three-point bending test on a sandwich sample. The sandwich samples, as shown in the
            following
            figure, were made of Aluminum 6061 on the outside and H80 PVC honeycomb on the inside (as specified in the
            book
            Experimental Characterization of Advanced Composite Materials).
            <br>
            The two ends were fixed, and a constant force of P = 80,000 N was applied at the center using the Load Frame
            machine in
            the lab. The goal of this experiment was to characterize the sample for its strength by recording the
            deflection for
            different geometrical samples.
            <br>
            Several large-scale parts, such as wings in the aerospace industry, use this sandwich combination due to its
            strong
            material properties. Without a doubt, this is an expensive set up, given the price of the materials and
            their sizes. I
            was interested in knowing whether it was possible to optimize the shape (thickness, length and width) of the
            samples
            such that their strength was maximized (least deflection), while at the same time keeping an efficient
            approach towards
            the total material used, hence saving on the cost.
            <br>
            The objective of this project was to determine the design parameters a sandwich beam (with Aluminum as face
            and H80 PVC
            Honeycomb as core) such as to minimize deflection under 3-point bending test with fixed load, whilst
            minimizing the
            weight of the beam.

            <b>Conclusion:</b>
            Our solution, derived from the SQP algorithm, satisfies all the requirements and constraints. The geometric
            values derived from the solution abide by the ASTM standards. The computation is not very expensive, since
            our problem formulas are not too complex. It is observed, however, that it becomes increasingly expensive
            when we shift our weight towards mass instead of deflection. Since the Langrange multiplier lamda values,
            along with the constraints are satisfied, SQP satisfies the KKT conditions. Given that out Pareto front does
            not provide a convex optimum, we can derive the optimal design point depending on our tradeoffs.
            <br>
            This method can be applied on much larger scales. As the example mentioned earlier, several large parts in
            the industry, such as the wings, have to go through this test. Of course, we want our parts to be extremely
            durable and structurally sound. However, problems arise when the material to be used is expensive (carbon
            fiber, etc.). Hence, a trade off must be done to satisfy this problem. Our objective can be easily expanded
            to larger scales and materials by changing the given properties.
