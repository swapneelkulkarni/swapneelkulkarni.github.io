        <b>Abstract:</b> Our project mission is inspired by some of the great thinkers in the aerospace industry who have dreamed of what it would take for humanity to truly become an interplanetary species. Born out of the Apollo era, many great dreamers such as Gerard O’Neil, Thomas Heppenheimer, Wernher von Braun, and Isaac Asimov discussed potential solutions for permanently colonizing Low Earth Orbit, the Moon, and even Mars. These solutions ranged from Earth-orbiting platforms with waterfalls and hang gliders to generational spaceships launched to the outer reaches of our solar system. Modern day visionaries such as Elon Musk and Robert Zubrin have proposed ideas such as colonizing the Red Planet with one million people and terraforming Mars. These inspirational, well-regarded leaders have grand visions for the future of the human race; we have chosen to draw inspiration from their work and create a more realizable approach to colonizing another planet. When discussing the context of our project mission within the larger realm of space exploration, it is important to note our mission is different than previous architectures which also explore living on Mars. Many missions that have been created in the past plan for visiting Mars and eventually returning to Earth. The goal of our project is to realistically analyze how a large population can sustain themselves with no resupply from Earth. While we understand this is quite the challenge, we believe our vision can realistically be achieved in the next two centuries.
